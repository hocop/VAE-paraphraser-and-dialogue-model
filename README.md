# Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
This repository is very raw and is yet only for my research.  
If looking for just VAE check out [my other repository](https://github.com/hocop/Semantic-variational-autoencoder).  
If looking for how to serve VAE (or seq2seq or any model) on GPU, check out [./serving](./serving) folder. I messed around a lot with it :)
